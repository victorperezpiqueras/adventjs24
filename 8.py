"""
It's time to select the fastest reindeer for Santa's journeys! ðŸ¦ŒðŸŽ„
Santa Claus has organized exciting reindeer races to determine which ones are in the best shape.

Your task is to display each reindeer's progress on a snow track in isometric format.

The information you receive:

    indices: An array of integers representing each reindeer's progress on the track:
    0: The lane is empty.
    Positive number: The reindeer's current position from the beginning of the track.
    Negative number: The reindeer's current position from the end of the track.
    length: The length of each lane.

Return a string representing the race track:

    Each lane has exactly length positions filled with snow (~).
    Each reindeer is represented with the letter r.
    Lanes are numbered at the end with /1, /2, etc.
    The view is isometric, so the lower lanes are shifted to the right.

Examples:

drawRace([0, 5, -3], 10)
/*
  ~~~~~~~~~~ /1
 ~~~~~r~~~~ /2
~~~~~~~r~~ /3
*/

drawRace([2, -1, 0, 5], 8)
/*
   ~~r~~~~~ /1
  ~~~~~~~r /2
 ~~~~~~~~ /3
~~~~~r~~ /4
*/

drawRace([3, 7, -2], 12)
/*
  ~~~r~~~~~~~~ /1
 ~~~~~~~r~~~~ /2
~~~~~~~~~~r~ /3
*/
